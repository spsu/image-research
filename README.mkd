**This is a work in progress!**

Image Research
==============

This is my C++ image research platform. It is a work in progress, and will be 
closely integrated with my robotics code (which is itself in serious need of an 
overhaul). 

Features
--------

* Reads images from V4L2 API.
* Utilizes Gtk+ gui instead of OpenCV's highgui.
