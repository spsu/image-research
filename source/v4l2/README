This API is very incomplete.

The primary motivation behind this V4L2 wrapper was to overcome a long-standing
bug in OpenCV that makes it impossible to resize camera feeds, and in the 
process, learn about the V4L2 architecture.

* The "wrap" directory code is incomplete and has a few faults.

* The "easyapi" directory contains a lot of jumbled code, and certainly needs
  to be refactored. 

		* Why is there a need for RgbImage2?
		* "Buffers" is a bad name for a class when wrap/Buffer.hpp exists.
		* Frame is messy
